The table provides a comparative overview of **OpenPerf** against other popular benchmarking frameworks, including **ImageNet**, **DataPerf**, **MLPerf**, **OGB** (Open Graph Benchmark), **MLBench**, and **TPCx-AI**. The comparison is structured across several dimensions to highlight the unique features, focus areas, and applicability of each framework. Below is a detailed breakdown of the dimensions:



​	1.	**Scope**:

​	•	Defines the domain each framework is intended for.

​	•	**OpenPerf** is designed for evaluating projects within the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem and encompasses a wide range of benchmark categories, including data type dimensions (such as Graph and Time-Series) and task dimensions (such as Classification and Regression), thereby incorporating the characteristics of most benchmarks. In contrast, other benchmarks like ImageNet focus on image classification, while specialized machine learning benchmarks such as MLPerf are dedicated to assessing hardware-based machine learning performance.

​	2.	**Benchmarks**:

​	•	Lists the types of benchmarks included within each framework.

​	•	**OpenPerf** stands out by offering a variety of benchmarks, including index-based, standard-based, model performance evaluation, and more, tailored to the OSS ecosystem. Other benchmarks are more specialized, like **OGB** focusing on graph-based tasks.

​	3.	**Focus**:

​	•	The primary goal of the benchmark, such as performance evaluation or task-specific metrics.

​	•	**OpenPerf** aims to foster the healthy and sustainable development of the OSS ecosystem, which differs from **ImageNet**’s focus on image recognition accuracy or **MLBench**’s general ML model performance.

​	4.	**Adaptability**:

​	•	Shows how flexible the benchmark is across different domains.

​	•	**OpenPerf** is specifically designed to be flexible for various OSS domains, while other benchmarks like **ImageNet** are narrowly focused on tasks such as image classification.

​	5.	**Scalability**:

​	•	Discusses how scalable the benchmark is in terms of its application to different types of workloads.

​	•	**OpenPerf** is highly scalable, supporting expansions into data science tasks, ML tasks, AI workloads, index tasks, and standard rank tasks. Other frameworks may be limited to specific dataset types or ML models.

​	6.	**Key Metrics**:

​	•	The main metrics that the benchmark tracks.

​	•	**OpenPerf** uses task-specific metrics, including accuracy, graph precision, and rank, which allows it to be adapted to a variety of tasks in the OSS ecosystem. Other frameworks focus on metrics such as accuracy, time-to-train, or inference speed.

​	7.	**End-to-End Evaluation**:

​	•	Indicates whether the benchmark provides comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation.

​	•	**OpenPerf** offers full end-to-end evaluation, covering various aspects of OSS projects, whereas some other frameworks like **ImageNet** do not provide such broad evaluations.

​	8.	**Real-World Application**:

​	•	Describes how the benchmark is applied in real-world scenarios.

​	•	**OpenPerf** is explicitly designed for OSS governance and performance analysis, ensuring practical relevance in real-world applications, while some benchmarks like **ImageNet** are primarily used in academic and research contexts.
